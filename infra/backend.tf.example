# Backend configuration for Terraform state management
# Copy this file to backend.tf and configure for your setup

# Option 1: GCS Backend (Recommended for GCP)
# terraform {
#   backend "gcs" {
#     bucket  = "my-company-terraform-state"
#     prefix  = "tx-gateway/staging"  # or "tx-gateway/production"
#     # Optionally enable state locking
#     # encryption is enabled by default for GCS
#   }
# }

# Option 2: S3 Backend (for AWS)
# terraform {
#   backend "s3" {
#     bucket         = "my-company-terraform-state"
#     key            = "tx-gateway/staging/terraform.tfstate"
#     region         = "us-east-1"
#     dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-lock"
#     encrypt        = true
#   }
# }

# Option 3: Terraform Cloud
# terraform {
#   cloud {
#     organization = "my-company"
#     workspaces {
#       name = "tx-gateway-staging"  # or "tx-gateway-production"
#     }
#   }
# }

# Best practices:
# 1. Use separate state files for staging and production
# 2. Enable state locking to prevent concurrent modifications
# 3. Enable encryption at rest for sensitive data
# 4. Use versioning on the storage bucket
# 5. Restrict access using IAM policies
